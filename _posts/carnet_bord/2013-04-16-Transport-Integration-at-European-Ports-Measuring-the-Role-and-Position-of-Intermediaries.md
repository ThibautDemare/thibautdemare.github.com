title: Transport Integration at European Ports - Measurng the Role and Position of Intermediaries
abstract: "<blockquote cite='http://www.ejtir.tbm.tudelft.nl/issues/2009_02/abstracts/2009_02_03.asp'>

<p>
The integration of ports within logistics and supply chains has become a major issue for both public and private players worldwide. Notably, the 
role of intermediaries in establishing efficient integration within transport chains in which ports are embedded is not well-known. International 
comparison is limited by the drastic lack of quantifiable information about inter-firm linkages and intermodal operations. Based on a European 
business database, this paper analyses the modal portfolio and employment distribution of about 8,000 transport firms, intermodal operators, and 
freight forwarders among 80 European ports. It allows measuring the degree to which different industries such as port activities, logistics, 
warehousing, road, sea, river, rail, and air transport, integrate within firms and within ports. Main results of the quantitative analysis show 
that transport integration and port performance have significant interdependence, but this is influenced by hinterland size, accessibility, and 
regional legacies differentiating Northern from Southern ports.

L'objectif de ce travail est de vérifier/décrir le rôle des intermédiaires du transport en terme d'intégration mais également
