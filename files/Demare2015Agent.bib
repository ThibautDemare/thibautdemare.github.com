abstract = "Abstract This paper presents the modelling of a logistic corridor. It integrates the port and the metropolitan logistics connected by an interface. Such a system can be seen as complex. A multi-scale point of view is adopted thanks to an agent-based approach which is coupled with dynamic graphs in order to represent in the one hand the actors involved in the transportation of goods, and in the other hand, the structured environment. The model is implemented in an agent-based simulation platform. Results about the impacts of parameters on the demand generating the flows of goods are finally discussed. "
